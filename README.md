# Quick Start

1. In `config.json`, configure the following values:

3. Run `npm start`
4. Enter the auth code that appears in the console into microsoft.com/link

# For Developers

If you have a local copy of 2based2wait with a personal config.json that's being tracked by git despite the .gitignore rule, run the following command:

`git update-index --assume-unchanged config.json`

# Keep in Mind

2based2wait ships with as many options __disabled by default__ as possible; including [auto-reconnect](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki/How-to-Auto-Reconnect-with-Supervisor), [ngrok tunneling](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki/How-to-Share-Accounts-With-A-Reverse-Proxy) (for sharing accounts), [coordination](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki/How-to-Proxy-Multiple-Accounts) (for multiple proxies), Discord webhooks, and much more.
