# Quick Start

1. In `config.json`, configure the following values:
    - `account.username`: Your Minecraft account playername.
    - `proxy.whitelist`: Playernames of accounts that are allowed to connect to the proxy.
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Enter the auth code that appears in the console into microsoft.com/link
5. Connect to `127.0.0.1` in Minecraft
    - If `127.0.0.1` doesn't work try `0.0.0.0`

*(See [configuration guide](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki/Configuration-Guide) to see how to enable features like Ngrok tunneling or Discord webhooks.)*
# Bendito's Notes
I've been working on adding a web interface to go along with the project. Not a whole lot has been changed just added and improved a few things. The pictures are outdated and I haven't fully tested the toggle buttons. Iâ€™ll get it done later.   

Change log:
- 
- Added web interface
- Added auto armor and auto totem
- Removed anti drown (interferes with pathfinder)
- Added whisper commands to mineflayer bot (Only works with whitelisted player)
- Other stuff I forget

I want to incorporate all features currently present and maybe merge this fork with the main project. All help is appreciated.

# For Developers

If you have a local copy of 2based2wait with a personal config.json that's being tracked by git despite the .gitignore rule, run the following command:

`git update-index --assume-unchanged config.json`

# Keep in Mind

2based2wait ships with as many options __disabled by default__ as possible; including [auto-reconnect](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki/How-to-Auto-Reconnect-with-Supervisor), [ngrok tunneling](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki/How-to-Share-Accounts-With-A-Reverse-Proxy) (for sharing accounts), [coordination](https://github.com/Enchoseon/2based2wait/wiki/How-to-Proxy-Multiple-Accounts) (for multiple proxies), Discord webhooks, and much more.
